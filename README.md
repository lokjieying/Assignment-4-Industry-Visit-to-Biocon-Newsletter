## 💡 Reflection
This industry visit helped me better understand how technology and information systems are applied in real biotechnology industries. I learned how computing systems support processes such as fermentation, purification, quality control and data monitoring in insulin production. The visit also allowed me to relate concepts from the Technology and Information System course, such as automation, databases and system integration to actual industrial practices. Seeing these concepts appiled in a real working environment made the knowledge I gained in class more practical and relevant. 

In addition to technical knowledge, this visit also improved my communication and teamwork skills through interaction with industry professionals and group members. Overall, this visit has given me a better understanding of career development opportunities in biotechnology and industrial computing and inspires me to further explore these fields.
